# Docker Security Improvements Summary

## Overview

We've significantly improved the Docker security posture of the coredns-ingress-sync controller by implementing several security best practices.

## Key Security Improvements

### 1. **Scratch Base Image**

- **Before**: Used `alpine:latest` (~5MB base + additional packages)
- **After**: Uses `scratch` (no base image, ~0MB)
- **Benefits**:
  - Minimal attack surface (no shell, no package manager, no utilities)
  - No known vulnerabilities from base OS
  - Smallest possible container size

### 2. **Non-Root User**

- **Before**: Ran as root user (UID 0)
- **After**: Runs as user 65534 (nobody)
- **Benefits**:
  - Follows principle of least privilege
  - Reduces impact of potential container breakouts
  - Complies with security best practices

### 3. **Static Binary Compilation**

- **CGO_ENABLED=0**: Disables CGO for fully static binary
- **Static linking**: `-ldflags='-w -s -extldflags "-static"'`
- **Benefits**:
  - No dynamic library dependencies
  - Compatible with scratch container
  - Smaller binary size (stripped symbols)

### 4. **Build Optimization**

- **Multi-stage build**: Separates build and runtime environments
- **Layer caching**: Copies go.mod/go.sum first for better caching
- **Minimal context**: Uses .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files

## Security Features

### Container Security

```dockerfile
# Runs as non-root user (nobody)
USER 65534:65534

# No shell or utilities available
FROM scratch

# Only essential certificates copied
COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/
```

### Binary Security

```dockerfile
# Static compilation with security flags
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build \
    -a -installsuffix cgo \
    -ldflags='-w -s -extldflags "-static"' \
    -o controller main.go
```

## Size Comparison

- **Previous**: ~50-100MB (alpine + packages)
- **Current**: ~37.3MB (scratch + static binary)
- **Reduction**: ~50%+ smaller

## Security Compliance

✅ **Non-root execution**: Runs as UID 65534
✅ **Minimal attack surface**: No shell, no package manager
✅ **No known vulnerabilities**: No base OS packages
✅ **Static binary**: No dynamic library dependencies
✅ **Stripped binary**: Debug symbols removed
✅ **Minimal context**: Only necessary files included

## Testing

The container has been tested to confirm:

- Builds successfully
- Runs as non-root user (65534)
- Executes without shell dependencies
- Maintains all functionality

## Deployment Updates

Update your Kubernetes deployments to leverage these security improvements:

```yaml
securityContext:
  runAsNonRoot: true
  runAsUser: 65534
  runAsGroup: 65534
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
  capabilities:
    drop:
      - ALL
```

## Recommendations

1. **Regular rebuilds**: Rebuild images regularly for latest dependencies
2. **Vulnerability scanning**: Scan images with tools like Trivy or Clair
3. **Runtime security**: Use Pod Security Standards or OPA Gatekeeper
4. **Network policies**: Implement Kubernetes Network Policies for additional isolation
