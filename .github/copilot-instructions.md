## Problem Statement

In a k8s environment, applications often communicate via DNS hostnames that are publicly resolvable. For internal communication between services, it is more efficient and secure to resolve hostnames to internal service addresses (e.g., the ClusterIP of the ingress-nginx service).

Managed services such as EKS restrict access to the control plane and etcd, making it difficult to update CoreDNS dynamically using traditional mechanisms. Additionally, managing CoreDNS rewrite rules statically (e.g., via Terraform) introduces operational overhead and lacks reactivity to changes in Kubernetes resources.

Goal

To dynamically update internal DNS records for Ingress hostnames managed by a specific IngressClass (e.g., nginx) so they resolve to a static internal value (e.g., ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local) using CoreDNS, without modifying the Ingress or Service resources directly.

Constraints

Only a single Ingress controller (e.g., nginx) is used.

The same Ingress resources are used to publish records via an existing external-dns instance to public DNS.

The internal DNS resolution should not affect or depend on the public DNS configuration.

Changes should be reactive to Ingress creation, deletion, and updates.

## Current Implementation Status

**Status**: Production-ready - The controller is fully functional with comprehensive testing, namespace filtering capabilities, and modular CI/CD pipeline.

**Architecture**: Kubernetes controller built with controller-runtime that automatically manages CoreDNS configuration for internal DNS resolution of ingress hostnames.

**Key Components**:

- Go-based controller using controller-runtime framework (modular architecture with cmd/ and internal/ packages)
- Helm chart for deployment with configurable values
- Automated CoreDNS ConfigMap and deployment management
- Cleanup scripts for proper uninstall procedures
- Comprehensive test suite with integration tests
- **Namespace filtering support**: Can monitor specific namespaces or cluster-wide
- **Modular CI/CD pipeline**: Reusable GitHub Actions for build, test, security scanning, and deployment

**Current Implementation**: Custom Controller with Automated CoreDNS Integration

The deployed controller:

**Watches Multiple Resources**:

- Ingress resources filtered by `spec.ingressClassName == "nginx"`
- **Namespace filtering**: Configurable to watch specific namespaces or all namespaces cluster-wide
- CoreDNS ConfigMap changes for reactive configuration management and defensive protection
- Automatic reconciliation on resource changes

**Defensive Configuration Management**:

- Continuously monitors CoreDNS ConfigMap for external changes (e.g., Terraform updates)
- Automatically re-adds import statement if removed by external tools
- Ensures volume mounts remain intact even if deployment is modified externally
- Reactive protection against configuration drift

**Generates DNS Configuration**:

- Creates dynamic ConfigMap with rewrite rules for each ingress hostname
- Maps each hostname to configurable internal target (default: ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local)
- Uses CoreDNS rewrite plugin instead of file plugin for better performance

**Automated CoreDNS Integration**:

- Automatically adds import statement to CoreDNS Corefile: `import /etc/coredns/custom/*.server`
- Dynamically adds volume and volume mount to CoreDNS deployment
- No manual CoreDNS configuration required
- Proper cleanup on uninstall via Helm pre-delete hooks
- **Defensive protection**: Continuously monitors and restores configuration if modified by external tools (e.g., Terraform)

**Configuration Management**:

- Helm chart with structured values (not environment variables)
- Configurable target CNAME, namespace, and ConfigMap names
- Optional auto-configuration can be disabled
- RBAC with minimal required permissions
- **Terraform compatibility**: Works alongside Terraform-managed CoreDNS configuration

**Deployment Architecture**:

- Packaged as Kubernetes deployment via Helm chart
- Uses ConfigMap volumes for dynamic DNS configuration
- Monitors and reacts to CoreDNS configuration changes
- Single binary with dual-mode operation (controller/cleanup) for maintainable operations

## CoreDNS Configuration Implementation

**Current Implementation**: The controller automatically manages CoreDNS configuration without manual intervention.

**Dynamic ConfigMap Approach**:

```yaml
# Controller creates: coredns-ingress-sync-rewrite-rules ConfigMap with dynamic.server
rewrite name exact api.app-staging.example.com ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local.
rewrite name exact web.app-staging.example.com ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local.
```

**Automatic CoreDNS Integration**:

- Controller automatically adds import statement to CoreDNS Corefile:

  ```text
  .:53 {
      import /etc/coredns/custom/*.server
      # ... existing configuration ...
  }
  ```

- Automatically adds volume and volume mount to CoreDNS deployment
- No manual CoreDNS configuration required

**Helm Values Configuration**:

```yaml
coreDNS:
  # IMPORTANT: Default is false for safety - must be explicitly enabled
  autoConfigure: false  # Set to true to enable automatic CoreDNS management
  namespace: kube-system
  configMapName: coredns

controller:
  ingressClass: nginx
  targetCNAME: ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local.
  # Namespace filtering configuration
  watchNamespaces: ""  # Empty = watch all namespaces cluster-wide
  # watchNamespaces: "production,staging"  # Comma-separated list for specific namespaces
  dynamicConfigMap:
    name: coredns-ingress-sync-rewrite-rules
    key: dynamic.server
```

## Logging Standards

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **controller-runtime structured logging (logr)** as the single logging standard.

**Standards**:

- ✅ **Use `ctrl.LoggerFrom(ctx)` in reconcilers** for context-aware logging
- ✅ **Use `ctrl.Log.WithName("component")` for global loggers** in managers/builders
- ✅ **Structured logging with key-value pairs**: `logger.Info("message", "key", value)`
- ✅ **Log levels**:
  - `logger.Info()` - Important operational messages (default visible)
  - `logger.V(1).Info()` - Debug messages (visible when LOG_LEVEL=debug)
  - `logger.V(2).Info()` - Verbose debug (very detailed, rarely used)
  - `logger.Error(err, "message")` - Error messages with error details
- ✅ **Environment variable**: `LOG_LEVEL` controls verbosity (debug, info, warn, error)
- ✅ **Helm integration**: `controller.logLevel` value passed to deployment

**Anti-patterns to avoid**:

- ❌ **No `log.Printf()`** - Use structured logging instead
- ❌ **No `fmt.Printf("DEBUG:")`** - Use `logger.V(1).Info()` instead  
- ❌ **No mixed logging libraries** - Only use controller-runtime logr
- ❌ **No capitalized error strings** - Follow Go conventions
- ❌ **No printf-style formatting** - Use structured key-value pairs

**Example Usage**:

```go
// In reconcilers (use context logger)
logger := ctrl.LoggerFrom(ctx)
logger.Info("Processing ingress", "namespace", ingress.Namespace, "name", ingress.Name)
logger.V(1).Info("Debug info", "details", someVariable)
logger.Error(err, "Failed to update ConfigMap", "configmap", name)

// In managers/components (use named logger)  
logger := ctrl.Log.WithName("coredns-manager")
logger.Info("Updated ConfigMap", "domains", len(domains))
```

**Future Considerations**:

- Validate that hosts in Ingress resources are owned by the intended team/namespace
- Add metrics endpoint to the controller
- Support for multiple ingress classes

## Conclusion

This solution successfully allows teams to dynamically resolve ingress-managed hostnames to an internal service endpoint using CoreDNS, without relying on public DNS or modifying Ingress resources. The implementation:

- **Fully automated**: Controller manages CoreDNS configuration automatically
- Comprehensive testing and proper cleanup procedures
- **Maintainable**: Helm chart with structured configuration and documentation
- **Secure**: Minimal RBAC permissions and proper resource isolation
- **Reactive**: Responds to Ingress changes in real-time

The controller successfully aligns with EKS constraints and enhances internal service-to-service communication within the cluster while maintaining separation from external DNS configuration.

## Terraform Integration & Defensive Configuration

**Problem**: CoreDNS configuration is typically managed by Terraform in production environments. When Terraform updates the CoreDNS ConfigMap, it can unintentionally remove the import statement added by this controller, breaking the internal DNS resolution functionality.

**Solution**: The controller implements defensive configuration management:

**CoreDNS ConfigMap Watching**:

- Controller watches the CoreDNS ConfigMap for any changes
- When external tools (like Terraform) update the ConfigMap, the controller immediately detects the change
- If the import statement is missing, it's automatically re-added
- This happens reactively within seconds of the external change

**Deployment Protection**:

- Controller also monitors the CoreDNS deployment for volume mount changes
- If external tools remove the volume mount, it's automatically restored
- Ensures the import statement can always access the dynamic configuration

**Reconciliation Logic**:

```go
// Every ConfigMap change triggers reconciliation
if err := r.ensureCoreDNSConfiguration(ctx); err != nil {
    log.Printf("Failed to ensure CoreDNS configuration: %v", err)
    return reconcile.Result{RequeueAfter: time.Minute}, err
}
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Zero downtime**: Configuration drift is corrected automatically
- ✅ **Terraform compatibility**: Works alongside existing Terraform workflows
- ✅ **Defensive protection**: Prevents accidental removal of critical configuration
- ✅ **Reactive response**: Changes are detected and corrected within seconds

**Example Scenario**:

1. Terraform applies changes to CoreDNS ConfigMap, removing import statement
2. Controller detects ConfigMap change within seconds
3. Controller automatically re-adds import statement
4. Internal DNS resolution continues working without interruption
5. Operations teams don't need to manually intervene
